# Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator written in Python. This script prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then computes and displays the result.

## Description

This project is a straightforward implementation of a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

It uses Python's `match` statement (available in Python 3.10 and newer) to handle the different operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `simple_calculator.py` file in your terminal.
2.  Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python simple_calculator.py
    ```
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the first value, the second value, and the desired operand.

### Example
```
enter first value: 10
enter second value: 5
enter operand: *
50
```
